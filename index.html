            <p>My name is Anderson Mourot and I am from Little Rock, Arkansas. I went to the University of Arkansas where I studied philosophy and finance. I am currently enrolled in the SMU Coding Bootcamp to learn the front-end and back-end skills needed to find a job I am passionate about. In my free time I enjoy going to concerts and hiking. This is my portfolio where you can view examples of the coding work I have done, as well as contact me for more information. Thank you for visiting!</p>
