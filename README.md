This is my portfolio project for Challenge 2. It has a profile picture of me, my name, and links to the rest of the page at the top. You can find an about me section with a short paragraph about myself. There are also links to my current projects, only one of which leads somewhere currently because I have only done one other project. Finally it has my contact information at the bottom of the page.
